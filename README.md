# Fire_Detection_UsingDNN_Project
This is the Deep neural network based Fire detection project using ResNet-18 Architecture.

I performed two deep neural network classifications for fire and non-fire images using the VGG19 and ResNet18 models to determine which model provides the best accuracy on my custom-created dataset which is of 600 images. The VGG19 model achieved a 62.50% test accuracy on the testing dataset. To improve upon this result, I explored the ResNet18 architecture and made modifications to the standard model code. I applied different hyperparameters such as the activation function, learning rate scheduler, and optimizer to enhance the model's performance.
The standard ResNet18 model utilizes the ReLU activation function, ReduceROnPlateau as a learning rate scheduler, and Adam as an optimizer. After studying various research papers and conducting analyses, I discovered that alternative activation functions such as ELU and Swish could potentially yield better results than ReLU. Similarly, I explored alternative options for the learning rate scheduler and optimizer as well. I opted for SGDR (Stochastic Gradient Descent with Warm Restarts)-based CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts as the learning rate scheduler and SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer) as the optimizer.
To determine the optimal combination of these three parameters, I conducted 12 iterations of the ResNet18 model and evaluated their testing accuracy on my custom dataset.
